# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Python

This repository contains the assignment given by Coursera's Machine Learning Course by Andrew NG.

The assignment given, was to be submitted in Octave programming language.
I did the assignment again in Python Programming Language.

This project contains algorithms(from scratch, in Python and in Octave):
1) [Linear Regression.](https://github.com/MohammadWasil/Coursera-Machine-Learning-Python/tree/master/CSR%20ML/WEEK%232)
2) [Logistic Regression.](https://github.com/MohammadWasil/Coursera-Machine-Learning-Python/tree/master/CSR%20ML/WEEK%233)
3) [Neural Network.](https://github.com/MohammadWasil/Coursera-Machine-Learning-Python/tree/master/CSR%20ML/WEEK%234)
4) [Neural Network Backpropagation.](https://github.com/MohammadWasil/Coursera-Machine-Learning-Python/tree/master/CSR%20ML/WEEK%235)
5) [Regularised Linear Regression and Bias Vs. Variance.](https://github.com/MohammadWasil/Coursera-Machine-Learning-Python/tree/master/CSR%20ML/WEEK%236)
6) [Support Vector Machines(SVM).](https://github.com/MohammadWasil/Coursera-Machine-Learning-Python/tree/master/CSR%20ML/WEEK%237)
7) [K-means Clustering And Principal Component Analysis.](https://github.com/MohammadWasil/Coursera-Machine-Learning-Python/tree/master/CSR%20ML/WEEK%238)
